# Project Overview

This application will be a simple todo list manager, where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. The frontend will be built with Next.js, while the backend will be implemented with Spring Boot.


## User Story

1. As a user, I want to be able to add tasks to my todo list, so that I can keep track of what I need to do.

2. As a user, I want to be able to edit tasks on my todo list, so that I can update them if anything changes.

3. As a user, I want to be able to mark tasks as completed, so that I can track my progress.

4. As a user, I want to be able to delete tasks from my todo list, so that I can remove them once they are no longer needed.

5. As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all of my tasks, so that I can see everything that I need to do in one place.

6. As a user, I want to be able to view the details of a specific task, so that I can see the name, description, and other information about it.

7. As a user, I want to be able to organize my tasks by priority, due date, or other criteria, so that I can focus on the most important or urgent tasks first.

8. As a user, I want to be able to search for tasks by keyword or other criteria, so that I can find specific tasks quickly and easily.

These user stories represent some of the basic features that a todo list manager application should include. By addressing these user stories, the application can provide users with a useful and intuitive way to manage their tasks and stay organized.
